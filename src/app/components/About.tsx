        A few years ago, I took a leap — leaving my comfort zone, moving across
        the world, and fully committing to a new career in software development.
        Every challenge taught me how much I love solving real problems with
        technology. Today, I specialize in building cross-platform apps that
        focus on simplicity and user experience. I&apos;m curious, creative, and
        always excited about learning something new — both in tech and in life.
